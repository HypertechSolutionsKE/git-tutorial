# A Brief Introduction to Git

## What is Git?

Git is an open-source version control system. It was designed and developed by Linus Torvalds (creator of the Linux kernel) and is the most popular version control system to date.


## 10 Reasons Why we use Git?

There are several reasons to use Git (or version control in general). We will just list a few reasons:

⋅⋅1. Git helps out a lot with respect to incremental code development and documentation.
⋅⋅2. Git is relatively easy to pick up and learn.
⋅⋅3. Git is very efficient and will not adversely affect your code.
⋅⋅4. If you make a mistake with your code, Git can easily revert you back to a working version of your code.
⋅⋅5. You can easily maintain multiple backups of your code that can update themselves without you needing to copy/paste your code over.
⋅⋅6. You can review the history of your code.
⋅⋅7. You can make multiple versions of your code.
⋅⋅8. You can work on experimental changes or features without breaking your working code.
⋅⋅9. You can keep track of contributions to the code when working as part of a team.
⋅⋅10. Companies use version control, so you will need to learn version control eventually.
